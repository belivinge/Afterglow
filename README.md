# Afterglow
Numeric GRB Afterglow models

Yesterday there was a meeting with Professor Ernazar Abdikamalov about the course PHYS 491 (Directed Study of Advanced Physics Topics). He agreed to be my supervisor and assigned me a project to create models of gamma rays and X-rays using afterglow. Every two weeks I will give him a progress report.

This repository was created to track my achievements in the process of studying this work.
